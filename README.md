# Blurt It!

Blurt It! is a web app that makes test prep for students easier, by streamlining a popular study method called blurting.

Blurting is a study method where you actively retrieve information from memory. To use the blurting method, you first review the material you're trying to study. Once you feel ready, put away the material. Then, type out all the information you can remember about the topic into this tool. It doesn't have to be in order, or with perfect grammar- just get it onto the screen. Then click Analyze. Powered by the OpenAI API, Blurt It! will provide you with three lists: correct concepts, incorrect concepts, and suggested further concepts to fill in the gaps. After reviewing your personalized feedback, study the topic again, paying extra attention to the parts you didn't get the first time. Keep repeating this process until you feel confident in your knowledge!

Currently, BlurtIt! is intended for studying topics related to computer science to ensure model reliability, but I am working to expand this.

The app is built with React and deployed to [Vercel](https://blurt-it-out.vercel.app).
